<div class="text_bubble"><div class="tgme_widget_message_text js-message_text" dir="auto">(public
 transportation nerd overtakes the channel) A bit about crowd 
engineering: there are two entrances to a platform 4-5, both on the left
 and on the right. Left one has escalators and very noticeable from the 
gates that are located behind on the right. Right one has only stairs 
but not immediately noticeable, and very liminal and quiet even on a 
busy day.</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble"><div class="tgme_widget_message_text js-message_text" dir="auto">There
 are lots of local and various express trains from Kyoto to Tokyo, and 
many are departing one after another, every 6 to 10 minutes during the 
rush hour. How do you wait for your train? Simple!<br><br>Platform has 
multiple waiting areas marked with different symbols: triangle, arrow, 
and circle. Incidentally, the timetable has corresponding symbols next 
to the car numbers.</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">All
 and all, it feels like we should try visit some more of Kyoto... But 
we're here only for 3 more days, and all of them are the part of the 
Golden Week, the biggest holiday season in Japan. Let's see...</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">Guess who decided to go to Kyoto for one more day just to finish up the "school trip" itinerary? üòè It is so "school trip" that even adult Japanese tourists around us kept mentioning that it feels like one.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/LLdWlMu49S4tS2wt6KN2w1uEwjUsKLPUXi8wOPilLLAKJdmmvD_oR0FggxIg.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/LLdWlMu49S4tS2wt6KN2w1uEwjUsKLPUXi8wOPilLLAKJdmmvD_oR0FggxIg.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">Today is going to be full of history and Yuzu Citrus.<br><br>Most
 schools in Japan arrange annual school trips for their students, and 
the standard destination for schools outside of Kansai region is Kyoto. 
It's fun, it's pretty, and you learn a lot of history even if you don't 
try. It's very cheap for schools, too - a hotel package could cost under
 $20 per night per student. <br><br>Kyoto school trip is such a standard
 life event for an average Japanese student, it is depicted in many, 
many animes about high school. You could pick any anime and follow the 
itinerary from it; we chose the show called Citrus*<br><br>* It's called
 Citrus because the protagonist's name is Yuzu, a Japanese citrus. Yuzu 
is something between the orange and the lemon; very popular in 
refreshing drinks, like this one - Yuzu Citrus And Tea</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">Welcome to To-ji temple, full name "The Temple 
for the Defense of the Nation by Means of the King of Doctrines". The 
temple was founded in 796, as one of the three Buddhist temples allowed 
in Kyoto The Capital (the emperor was worried Buddhist influence was 
spreading too wide). It got its current shape around the 9th century. 
The pagoda you can see was destroyed by fire four times (lightning is 
dangerous!), but it was always rebuilt the same way as the original (at 
least that's what the leaflet says). The current pagoda was constructed 
in 1643. It is designed to be earthquake-resilient; each floor is not 
attached to other floors, so the building "dances" when there is an 
earthquake.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The temple halls are in use, there are ancient 
Buddha statues inside. This temple is the most important temple and a 
founding ground for Esoteric Buddhism, an important branch of Japanese 
Buddhism.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The temple's garden is so picturesque it's hard
 to believe the grass and the heron aren't plastic. But no, they are 
very, very real.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">To our next destination! This is a must-see for
 any Kyoto trip, allegedly. Toji temple didn't have many tourists, but 
this place always has tourists, be it raining or snowing. <br><br>If 
there was an award for the most extravagant Japanese entrance ticket, 
this place would've won, I think (that's the ticket on the photo).</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">This is not just a ticket, it's also an ofuda - a paper talisman to seal evil and invite the good luck.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">There are all sorts of designs for ofudas, you might have seen them in occult anime, like Bakemonogatari or DAN DA DAN.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">Would you look at that. Kinkakuji, "The temple 
of the Golden Pavilion". It used to be the palace of a shogun, built in 
1399, but the will of the shogun was to convert the palace into a 
temple, and that was done after his death. It is very showy, because in 
Muromachi period it was important to show off your wealth.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/Yx6ocklgVTRWRaOubyz3oamsmN4baqfuQp9wVw3NOC8n6ySJrKXl0IGoeKnJ.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/Yx6ocklgVTRWRaOubyz3oamsmN4baqfuQp9wVw3NOC8n6ySJrKXl0IGoeKnJ.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The second and the third stories of the temple 
aren't just yellow. They are pure gold leaf. The shogun who built it was
 the real deal!!!<br><br>At this point, it is important to explain who Shogun were, and how they were related to the Emperor of Japan.<br><br>According
 to the official information, the first Japanese emperor lived around 
the 7th century BC, and was a demi-god. According to historians, it is 
possible to confirm the historical identities of Japanese emperors at 
least since the 5th century AD. The dynasty of the Japanese imperial 
family runs from those ancient times, a descendant of Amaterasu and thus
 the head of Shinto religion. Divine rulers, or something.<br><br>However,
 it was not uncommon for different people to usurp the power. In Heian 
period that was usually achieved through appointing a regent. The 
emperors themselves sometimes would even retire to a monastery as monks!<br><br>Everything has changed in 1185. A top ranked general, Shogun, was appointed a regent, and since then Japan had been a Shogunate.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/ocI9KtflaQbw4zOn1EWzrjsEPwufbqCiO-yMBSdjtJX86oUqJEO6WWt6QQwX.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/ocI9KtflaQbw4zOn1EWzrjsEPwufbqCiO-yMBSdjtJX86oUqJEO6WWt6QQwX.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">Since then and until the Meiji Restoration, the
 commanding general of army, Shogun, had been the ruler of all Japan. 
Thus, this used to be the palace of the guy who ruled Japan. Neat!<br><br>The design of the building is so iconic, many many many temples copied it, and then other temples and shrines copied the copies.<br><br>Why
 Shinto shrines would copy Buddhist temples? Well, it's complicated! 
Until the Meiji era, both religions were intertwined. It wasn't uncommon
 for Buddhist temples to have a side Shinto shrine with Kami, and Shinto
 shrines often had Buddhist temples on the side. It's been a bit over 
150 years since the religions were forcibly separated (at least on the 
paper, in the legal sense).</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">Kinkakuji temple complex looks serene, but 
that's because all the pretty buildings are separated from the tourists 
by the "DO NOT CROSS" lines. There are SO MANY tourists it might be 
difficult to just take a photo of the building. Unfortunate.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">As a working temple, it offers a vending machine with fortunes, and sells amulets and ofudas. Let's try our fortune...</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">"future blessing" aka "slightly better than 
misfortune". It's best to leave the omikuji tied to the wall of the 
temple so all the evils would avoid us!</div><div><br></div>

<hr>
<div class="text_bubble">Leaving the crowds of tourists behind, we take 
the city bus to the Imperial Garden. It looks like it might rain, and it
 seems the tourists are avoiding the Imperial Palace because of it!</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/GEWFoke5YpcuzD_REEjR9dg_M2CNRSkW-pjOrh-tiAAkNKJ9sGwkjMW0Iqvg.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/GEWFoke5YpcuzD_REEjR9dg_M2CNRSkW-pjOrh-tiAAkNKJ9sGwkjMW0Iqvg.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The Kyoto Imperial Palace was built in 794 AD, 
after the capital had moved to Kyoto from Nara. It had been rebuilt many
 times since, the latest iteration was in 1788. Curiously enough, the 
1788 rebuilt used the original Heian designs from the 8th century for 
all the important buildings in the palace.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/hLlBQg1EYXCCufvdcrJETEH-fJ1Jifkc_r4spSQ7fGqFT6NJHGiJb53Da0no.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/hLlBQg1EYXCCufvdcrJETEH-fJ1Jifkc_r4spSQ7fGqFT6NJHGiJb53Da0no.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The palace has many layers of walls and many 
gates. Inside the gate for visitors there was another gate for visitors 
(this one), as well as waiting rooms.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/T4Xock50ndqJRVrpwB5BXe9DPkdpapRXmWubzksWxNv2gxn4eG-jeAG5uyT8.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/T4Xock50ndqJRVrpwB5BXe9DPkdpapRXmWubzksWxNv2gxn4eG-jeAG5uyT8.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The waiting rooms were decorated with luxurious
 paintings. There were three waiting rooms, dividing the visitors by 
their social stranding.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">One more gate, I promise, bro, one more gate and you can see the emperor!!!</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The emperor himself had a separate gate he used, bypassing three other gates that visitors had to go through.<br><br>Do you see the tourists? I don't! Lucky~</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/J3GMhk8dafClGq8q-0q4GJXMmlQbIxJH9J0mQGltGn-nLD_GecI0FieEqmD2.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/J3GMhk8dafClGq8q-0q4GJXMmlQbIxJH9J0mQGltGn-nLD_GecI0FieEqmD2.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">It would be a mistake to think that the emperor
 had to go only through one gate. There are at least two more gates 
leading to the inner palace.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="img_link"><a href="full_tabi_files/dsy1eNf915cAsDKkZB2ROymwmhsJ2INmY5vNVbayNX4bCTBfZAHwSh1yygeN.jpg"><img src="full_tabi_files/dsy1eNf915cAsDKkZB2ROymwmhsJ2INmY5vNVbayNX4bCTBfZAHwSh1yygeN.jpg"></a></div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The imperial palace used to have even more layers outside, but even now it's a labyrinth.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">Finally, a proper glance at the exterior of the inner palace! You can imagine it used to be an area bustling with the courtiers.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The palace has a very special temple. It was 
used to store the mirror Yata no Kagami until it was moved to its 
current location in The Shrine. <br><br>What's up with the mirror Yata no Kagami? And what are the jewel Yasakani no Magatama and sword Kusanagi no Tsurugi? Well...</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">It is said that the first emperor of Japan has 
received those three powerful magical artifacts from his 
grand-grandfather. His grand-grandfather is actually a grand child of 
Amaterasu herself, the goddess of Sun in Shinto and the head of the 
Japanese pantheon.<br><br>The magatama is said to be a jewel that 
Amaterasu used to create gods. Amaterasu also created agriculture and 
weaving, according to the legends. <br><br>Amaterasu wasn't the first 
goddess (she's a daughter of Izanagi and his sister-wife Izanami), and 
she had a younger siblingTsukuyomi (The Moon) and a yonger brother 
Susano (The Storm).<br><br>Susano was kind of a jerk; he won a fight 
against Amaterasu, and to rub it into her face, he defecated on her 
throne. Amaterasu almost forgave him, but then he threw a freaking horse
 through a roof of the palace, killing one of Amateurs maidens. 
Heartbroken, Amaterasu hid herself in The Heavenly Rock Cave.<br><br>Do you see a problem?<br><br>Reminder: Amaterasu is THE Sun.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The cave exists in Iwato, and is so secluded 
the visitors of any kind are not allowed. Anyhow, the Earth without sun 
sucks, so the lesser gods started to think of a plan on luring Amaterasu
 out of the cave.<br><br>The plan was conceived by the god of Wisdom, 
Omoikane, and executed by the goddess of arts and dawn Ame-no-Uzume. 
Ame-no-Uzume put the magatama on the tree next to the cave (to increase 
the magical power) and started to dance and laugh. Amaterasu asked 
Ame-no-Uzume what was happening, and Ame-no-Uzume lied that a new, even 
greater, goddess was born. Amaterasu, curious, peeked out of the cave - 
and this is where Ame-no-Uzume used the Yata no Kagami mirror to show 
Amaterasu her own reflection.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">Amaterasu got out of the cave. Susano was sent 
to the hell for his behaviour, where he had to kill a legendary eight 
headed snake Yamato no Orochi. The tail of the snake had a sword, which 
Susano offered to Amaterasu as a sign of reconciliation. The sword is, 
of course, Kusanagi no Tsurugi.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">The sword, the mirror and the magatama jewel 
are thus the Imperial Regalia, owned by the emperor. They are stored in 
the highest security temples in the country (four rows of walls!). The 
public had never seen them, but they are brought to the sunlight (in 
protective packages) during the each emperor's ascension.<br><br>Maybe the only magic they have is being some 2000 years old, but even so, it's pretty impressive.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The access to the interior of the palaces is 
forbidden. The palace is actually still used by the emperor every few 
years or decades.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">This is "The Room Where It Happens": a part of 
the inner palace where it was decided that the Meiji Restoration will 
happen. After 7 centuries of the Shogun rule, Japan has faced 
difficulties:  famine led to economical difficulties; foreign influences
 insisted Japan had to embrace the world trade; the merchants gained 
influence and the samurai had lost it. The emperor Meiji declared that 
he will get the power back, will open the country for foreigners, and 
abolish the feudalism. It was met with a civil war, but the Shogunate 
fell, and the modern Japan was born.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The next area of Kyoto has a train stop aptly 
named Inari. This is where you can find The Fushimi Inari shrine, the 
head/main shrine for the goddess circle Inari (mentioned a while ago). 
It was founded in 711 AD, and is a huge tourist trap ever since.<br><br>There
 are as many tourists as in the Golden Pavilion. Despite the signs "This
 is a place of worship, be quiet, for Pete's sake", it is bustling with 
traders and full of loud tourists.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">Inari's messengers are foxes, the cats aren't welcomed. But the cats still go in.</div><div><br></div>
<div class="text_bubble">Buddhists are generally accepting of cats in 
temples, and say they're auspicious, but in Shinto the position of a cat
 is far more perilous. Yes, Inari might take an appearance of a cat, if 
they wish so, but far more often a cat is associated with being a 
monster (yokai). Old cats, according to legends, turn into bakeneko (a 
prankster cat), or, worse still, a malicious nekomata.<br><br>Some say 
that bakeneko, cats that walk on their back legs, speak Japanese and 
drink lamp oil, come from the fact that Japanese people used sardine oil
 as the lamp oil. The cats would have to reach for the lamps to drink 
it, standing on their back feet, and meowing happily, as if talking.</div><div><br></div>

<div class="text_bubble">The Inari shrine is famous for its complicated 
layout (4 kilometres of mountain trails) and its path of red torii gates
 called Senbon Torii ("A thousand torii"). There are only some 800 
toriis at the moment, but the number is increasing.<br><br>Rich people 
and organisations started to donate torii gates to shrines in the Edo 
period (17th century) either to have a wish come true, or in gratitude 
for a wish coming true. This tradition still continues.<br><br>The path 
would have been absolutely magical if it wasn't for an overwhelming 
amount of tourists. It took some ten minutes to take this photo, and the
 very next moment the tourists started flowing through the gates once 
again. I am aware that I am a part of the problem, thank you :)</div><div><br></div>
