<title>Windows 2: Final Fantasy of operating systems</title>
<body><div class="post">
<h1>Windows 2: Final Fantasy of operating systems</h1>
<p>It is common knowledge that Final Fantasy could have been the last game in the series. It is far less known that Windows 2, released around the same time, could too have been the last. If anything, things were more certain: even Microsoft believed that Windows 2 would be the last.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/00_iroke.png" alt=""></p>
<p class="imgdesc">PC Paintbrush and MS Excel were some of the most successful programs for Windows 2.</p>
<p>The miracle of overwhelming commercial success brought incredible attention to Windows. The retro community and computer historians generally seem to be interested in the legendary origins of the system (how it all began) or in its turnabout Windows 3.0 release (what did they do right?).</p>
<p>This story instead will be about the underdog of Windows, version 2. To understand where it all went wrong, we must start looking at events that happened even before Microsoft was founded. By necessity, I will talk a lot about Windows 1, too. Instead of following interpersonal/corporate drama, I will try to focus on the technical aspects of Windows and its competitors, as well as the technological limitations of the computers around the time. It is going to be quite a journey, and it might seem a bit random, but I promise that eventually, it all will start making sense.</p>
<p>Let's start with some hands-on Windows 2 experience to tempt you to read the full story!</p>
</div>
<hr/><hr/><hr/>
<div class="post">
<h2>Living with Windows 2</h2>
<p>Let's get a time machine, and teleport to the 27th of December 1989 or so.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/01_xls.png" alt="win2live/01_xls.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Most people would experience Windows 2 through a version shipped with Microsoft Excel. It can calculate stonks and plot charts. What else do you need?</p>
<h3>Standard applications</h3>
<p>Due to a number of reasons, standard Windows 2 applications are almost exactly the same as Windows 1 applications.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/02_executive.png" alt="win2live/02_executive.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">MS-DOS Executive is sort of a file manager for Windows that is used to start programs.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/03_notepad.png" alt="win2live/03_notepad.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Notepad is as unassuming as ever. No Copilot yet. Note how minimized applications are represented by an icon on a desktop. This used to be a common idea across many contemporary systems.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/04_wricalc.png" alt="win2live/04_wricalc.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Calculator is very minimalistic. Write is clearly Microsoft's response to Apple's MacWrite.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/05_paint.png" alt="win2live/05_paint.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Paint is similar to MacPaint, too. It is monochrome, and it looks exactly like Paint in Windows 1, but uses a different file format (?!).</p>
<p><img src="win2live/06a_open.png" alt="win2live/06a_open.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">There is no proper Open file dialog. It was implemented as a part of CommDlg in Windows 3.1.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/06b_save.png" alt="win2live/06b_save.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">It's Wild West of modal windows, folks! Also, I wonder what "Microsoft Word format" they mean; there were at least Word For Dos and Word For Mac at this point.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/07_calcard.png" alt="win2live/07_calcard.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Calendar and Cardfile are more useful than they might seem.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/08_control.png" alt="win2live/08_control.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Control panel allows to create your own Hot Dog Stand interface, if you want.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/09_terminal.png" alt="win2live/09_terminal.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">The networking tools in Windows 2.0 are basically non-existent. The terminal tool is beyond basic.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/10_reversi.png" alt="win2live/10_reversi.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Built-in entertainment is represented by an intellectual game of reversi. You need 3.0 for Solitaire, 3.1 for Minesweeper, and WfW for Hearts.</p>
<h3>Additional software</h3>
<p>The list is non-exhaustive, and even misses some major pieces of software (Corel DRAW!, for example). This is more to illustrate that Windows 2 had <em>some</em> useful apps.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/11_word.png" alt="win2live/11_word.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Back in the 80s, Microsoft's office apps were much more popular on Mac than on PC. Maybe that's because Word for DOS was really ugly. It took Microsoft years to bring graphical Word on the PC, and you're witnessing it.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/12_msproj2.png" alt="win2live/12_msproj2.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Perhaps this is why Microsoft made Project? To release their software in time.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/13_devtools.png" alt="win2live/13_devtools.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Windows 2 SDK is shipped with a few neat tools for software developers. It is not quite Visual C yet, but it is not not visual.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/14_aldus.png" alt="win2live/14_aldus.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Aldus Pagemaker was one of the first programs to release for Windows. Some video cards supported screens as large as 1024x768 in 256 colours, which is pretty darn good for typesetting. Pagemaker 3 could use much more RAM than Pagemaker 1, and is actually quite usable.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/15_ai.png" alt="win2live/15_ai.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Adobe Illustrator does not require an account just yet; there is no generative AI in it either.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/16_ai2.png" alt="win2live/16_ai2.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">It is quite basic as far as vector editors go, but it has CMYK and PostScript support.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/17_xeroxp.png" alt="win2live/17_xeroxp.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Xerox Presents is a PowerPoint-style app. There was no PowerPoint for Windows just yet, as Microsoft has just bought the company that made it.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/18_xeroxp2.png" alt="win2live/18_xeroxp2.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Xerox Presents comes with some nifty vector clipart, and even supports vector scalable fonts.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/19_clearview.png" alt="win2live/19_clearview.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">It is quite obvious that MS-DOS Executive is not a great way to start programs. There were many alternatives, and Clearview was one of the more advanced ones.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/20_wam.png" alt="win2live/20_wam.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Windows Application Manager aims to solve the same problem, but cheaper.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/21_paint_dan.png" alt="win2live/21_paint_dan.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">ZSoft Paintbrush is a bit of a pain to use on Windows, because Windows only supports 8 colours in VGA mode. But it looks just like Microsoft Paintbrush from Windows 3.0.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/22_paint_yaga.png" alt="win2live/22_paint_yaga.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">That's right! Because Microsoft has licensed ZSoft Paintbrush for its MS Mouse and MS Windows. Also. you can tell that I just needed an excuse to add two screenshots of the program...</p>
<p><img src="win2live/23_xvtdraw.png" alt="win2live/23_xvtdraw.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">XVT Draw is a shareware vector editor. It feels much faster than Illustrator or DRAW!</p>
<p><img src="win2live/24_opusmidi.png" alt="win2live/24_opusmidi.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Opus Composer, also known as WinSong, was made for Windows 1, but it is slightly more useable on Windows 2. It supposed to support MIDI.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/25_opustape.png" alt="win2live/25_opustape.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Opus Tapedeck is a counterpart for Opus Composer that works just as a player utility.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/26_packrat.png" alt="win2live/26_packrat.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">The genre of desktop organisers seemed to be popular. This is Packrat. Another popular PIM for Windows 2 was IBM Current.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/27_casette.png" alt="win2live/27_casette.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">CaseLiner is a tool for generating liners for your mixtapes.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/28_comm.png" alt="win2live/28_comm.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Comprog brings networking on Windows 2.0 to the next level: now you can connect to BBSes and download files.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>There weren't many games for Windows 2, but there were some.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/29_chessnet.png" alt="win2live/29_chessnet.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">ChessNet allows you to play chess over modem. It's much faster than chess over email!</p>
<p><img src="win2live/30_solitaire.png" alt="win2live/30_solitaire.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Remember I told you there is no Solitaire for Windows 2? Turns out, I lied! There is a shareware version that looks nothing like MS Solitaire but still as fun to play.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/31_backg.png" alt="win2live/31_backg.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Backgammon has a case of a quirky interface. It's likely going to work just fine in Windows 1, too.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/32_xword.png" alt="win2live/32_xword.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Crosswords are fun. Don't you like crosswords? Crosswords!</p>
<p><img src="win2live/33_starba.png" alt="win2live/33_starba.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Starbase is probably the only example of an <em>action</em> game for Windows 2. Someone tries to bomb your star base! It is hectic and very violent.</p>
<p><img src="win2live/34_taipei.png" alt="win2live/34_taipei.png"></p>
<p class="imgdesc">Taipei is very pretty, and this is why I put it at the end.</p>

A research division of Xerox, Xerox PARC, releases an experimental computer "workstation" called Alto. An attempt to streamline "The mother of all demos", Alto is the first mass-produced system with a graphical user interface. The computer is made from hundreds of tiny computer chips, and the price starts at $32,000. There is very little demand for such a computer.

<h2>1977-06 Apple II</h2>
<p><img src="history/03_apple2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<details> 
  <summary>The boom of microcomputers begins</summary><div class="cut">
Since 1970, the semiconductor and computer chip industry has kept doubling chip features while keeping the costs relatively constant. By 1977, a whole computer processor, comparable in performance to Apollo Guidance Computer's processor, would fit on a silicon crystal smaller than a fingernail and might cost about $10.
<p>This created an opportunity to produce small, inexpensive computers for individual usage. A remarkable example of such a computer is the Apple II, released in June 1977, with a retail price of $1,298.</p>
<p>Two other significant computers, Commodore PET and TRS-80, were released the same year, and a competitive microcomputer market started to form. There was little software available for these computers at first, and owners often had to write their own programs using built-in BASIC programming language.</p>

<h2>1979-06 Intel 8088</h2>
<p><img src="history/04_intel88.jpg" alt=""></p>
<details> 
  <summary>A word about memory models and address bus sizes.</summary><div class="cut">
<h3>Integer number sizes</h3>
<p>The overwhelming majority of processors in early home computers were &quot;8-bit&quot;; that is, they could operate only with integer numbers between 0 and 255. Computing bigger numbers would require the processor to perform multiple steps.</p>
<p>If you're struggling to grasp the idea, imagine calculating a sum of 789 and 123 using only sums of single digits: start from the right-most number with 9+3, that's 2 and carry one, then 8+2+carry, that's 1 and carry one, and then 7+1+carry is 9, so the total is 912. Calculating a sum of 1234 and 5678 would require a similar procedure on an 8-bit computer.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated and thus more expensive 16-bit processor could solve this math problem in a single operation because the biggest integer number it can handle is 65,535. A big chunk of computing deals with numbers around this range, so a 16-bit processor with the same &quot;number of operations per second&quot; as an 8-bit processor will likely be much more performant.</p>
<h3>Address bus size</h3>
<p>The central processor usually doesn't have much memory to store the data. Instead, it stores data in memory chips connected to the CPU through &quot;address bus&quot; and &quot;data bus&quot;. The data bus transfers the actual information back and forth, while the address bus determines where to store the data in memory.</p>
<p>Thus, the address bus size (&quot;width&quot;) determines how much RAM the computer can use without relying on engineering tricks. The logic is the same as with the integer sizes:</p>
<p>8-bit bus = 256 addresses,
16-bit bus = 64K (65,536) addresses,
20-bit bus = 1M (1,048,576) addresses,
24-bit bus = 16M addresses,
32-bit bus = 4G addresses</p>
<p>When processors calculate the addresses for the address bus, they usually have to deal with the same limitations as during integer calculations. Thus, calculating a 16-bit bus address would require multiple operations on an 8-bit processor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any serious computing requires at least a few kilobytes of memory. Hence, computers based on 8-bit processors usually had to have a 16-bit address bus and no choice but to regularly spend multiple operations calculating addresses in the memory.</p>
<h3>Memory management model</h3>
<p>The simplest way to use computer memory is sometimes called a &quot;flat model&quot;. A computer with a 16-bit address bus using flat memory can have not more than 64K of addressable memory elements. This is a problem because things like text documents, spreadsheets and photos simply do not fit in 64K.</p>
<p>A way to bypass this limitation is to implement &quot;bank switching&quot; (or simply &quot;banking&quot;). Let's say you want 128K of memory on a system with a 16-bit data bus. A common way to implement this is to divide 128K into 8 &quot;banks&quot; of 16K each and add clever circuitry to allow you to choose how these banks are connected to the address bus &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, you can have banks 0, 1 and 2 available to the processor at addresses 0, 1x16K and 2x16K, but the 3x16K addresses could be connected to any of the banks. Voila, your 16-bit system can access more memory! The downside is that you cannot directly copy things between, say, bank 4 and bank 6, as they cannot be mapped to the &quot;address space&quot; simultaneously.</p>
<p>Many 16-bit processors use an advanced variant of bank switching known as &quot;segmentation&quot;. With segment memory, a processor can access multiple 64K &quot;segments&quot; simultaneously. For example, x86 processors have a Code Segment, which has the program you execute now, a Data Segment to access your data, an Extra Segment to compare or copy memory between two segments and a Stack Segment to store intermediate calculation results. It is much faster than banking but still requires the programmer to use a lot of magic to avoid the limitations imposed by the 64K segment size.</p>
<h3>Intel 8086 and Intel 8088</h3>
<p>Both i86 and i88 are 16-bit processors with 20-bit address bus. This means that they support up to 1 megabyte of RAM. These processors use segment memory to avoid long, expensive memory address computations. Initially, the listed price was $124, but quickly dropped to just $14.</p>
<h3>A glimpse into the future - Motorola 68000</h3>
<p>Introduced just a few months after the Intel 8088, Motorola 68000 is a 32-bit processor with a 24-bit address bus and a convenient flat memory model. It was seen as a more expensive chip, with the price tag starting at $125. Curiously, the price decreased to about $15 in just a few years.</p>

<h2>1979-?? Steve Jobs decides to make a computer with a graphical interface</h2>
<p>Steve Jobs sees Xerox Alto in Xerox PARC, and becomes obsessed with graphical interfaces. Shortly after, he strucks a deal with Xerox, where Xerox could buy a chunk of Apple stock in exchange for Xerox'es patents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was so blinded by the first thing they showed me, which was the graphical user interface. I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life. Now remember it was very flawed. What we saw was incomplete, they’d done a bunch of things wrong. But we didn’t know that at the time but still thought they had the germ of the idea was there and they’d done it very well. And within – you know – ten minutes it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this some day. It was obvious. You could argue about how many years it would take. You could argue about who the winners and losers might be. You could’t argue about the inevitability, it was so obvious.</p>

<p>The Blue Giant becomes mildly interested in a home computers market, and decides to build a cheap home computer, uncharacteristically for the company outsourcing many parts of the project. A small group of engineers starts working on IBM PC, using Intel 8088 processor because it is the cheapest 16-bit CPU they can find.

<p>Xerox polishes ideas from Alto and releases the very first computer using &quot;desktop&quot; paradigm and &quot;folders&quot;, Xerox Star 8010. It is a wonderful machine, with a high-resolution screen, mouse, what-you-see-is-what-you-get, and so on. Alas, the basic model costs $75,000.</p>

<p>IBM releases its home computer IBM PC, with a price tag starting at an almost reasonable $1,565. IT comes either with BASIC, or a disk operating system called PC-DOS. Either way, all you're getting is black screen with white letters on it. The operating system was developed by Microsoft, a compiler company that supplied BASIC to maybe half of all the home computers.</p>

<h2>1981-09 Rumours about Apple Lisa</h2>
<p><img src="history/09_lisa.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Three years in the works, Apple Lisa starts to get a shape. Rumours about it start spreading around the industry, naming it an upcoming Xerox Star competitor. Journalists are thrilled to learn that it probably will support a mouse (which was invented a long ago, but was not a common accesory just yet).</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>1981-09 Microsoft Interface Manager (?)</h2>
<p><img src="history/10_interfacemana.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Even in the early 80s there was a big demand for user-friendliness. Microsoft starts investing into its own user-friendly interface, as seen in the above note from Paul Allen (c. 1982). It is likely that the work on something known internally as Interface Manager has begun not later than in September 1981.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1981, the Apps division of Microsoft (Microsoft had two primary divisions during this time - &quot;Systems&quot; and &quot;Apps&quot;, for systems software and application development respectively) began to develop a common interface library for all of the productivity applications being developed within the division at the time (mostly Word and the Multiplan spreadsheet). This went by several names, notably MUSH (Microsoft User SHell) and Interface Manager, and is an entirely text-mode UI framework signified by the &quot;session control&quot; strip with context-specific commands at the bottom of the screen. There were also brief plans for a &quot;visual shell&quot; using this UI to be shipped using DOS 2.0, but these were scrapped before the final release. Variants of the MUSH/Interface Manager interface would ship in DOS Word 1.0 and Multiplan in 1982...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>-- Betawiki</em></p>
<p>It all started with Charles Simonyi. He created the first WYSIWYG word processor for Xerox PARC, got tired of it, and around 1980, was looking for new opportunities. His ex-coworker and founder of 3Com, Robert Metcalfe, has introduced Charles to Bill Gates, where Simonyi started working on a spreadsheet program. Shortly after, Simonyi hired his co-worker from Xerox PARC, Richard Brodie, to help with Multiplan. This was the beginning of the Apps division. It is said [citation needed] that when Brodie joined Microsoft, Multiplan did not have a menu system just yet, and Brodie was insistent on adding one. Brodie himself mentions that he primarily was working on Microsoft p-Code C compiler, though. So, this might or might not be the beginning of the Windows code.</p>

<h2>1981-11 VisiCalc's developers are actively working on a graphical interface</h2>
<p><img src="history/11_rosetta_visicorp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Impressive interface of Xerox Star and rumours about not-yet-released Lisa make the creators of VisiCalc consider their future investment. The company's president learns about a small team from Texas (Scott Warren and Dennis Abbe) who created a variant of Xerox PARC's Smalltalk with a windowing interface for seriously underpowered home computers, and hires them to create the company's next big thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h2>1982-08 Microsoft Multiplan</h2>
<p><img src="history/12_multiplan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Microsoft has been working on their own VisiCalc competitor. Despite the rock star project's staff, Multiplan doesn't sell all too well. Journalists are curious whether Microsoft might release a word processor, and the company's representative hints that they might be working on a mouse-controlled interface:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way that the word processor becomes really nice is when you get away from keyboard input. Which means, use keyboard input for words only and use something like a mouse, or a joy stick, or a track ball for the editing commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Vern Raburn, President of Microsoft Consumer Products, in interview for PC Magazine April 1982</p>
<p>The command strip bar at the bottom of the screen was considered quite user-friendly at the time. Note that even the very first release of Multiplan supports multiple &quot;windows&quot; to display multiple spreadsheets at the same time.</p>

<p>A demo of VisiOn, the graphical multi-tasking shell by VisiCorp, is a smash hit on the biggest PC conference COMDEX. Multiple sources quote that it influenced Bill Gates to prioritise work on what later will become &quot;Windows&quot;, but it is unclear whether he was inspired or outraged. Perhaps, he was not comfortable with VisiCorp entering his home turf, operating systems (despite Microsoft just entering the VisiCorp's one).</p>

<p>Xerox Star was pretty close to the idea of modern computers, but it was still very rough around the corners. For example, if one window would overlap with the other, the bottom window would stop updating. Not a big deal unless your bottom window is a clock or a mail app. Apple Lisa, though, polished the interface. Just check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/m1rROTVVHls?t=311">video</a>. It was more affordable than Star, but $9,995 was still quite a price tag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The most important development in computers in the last five years, easily outpacing [the IBM PC]&quot;
<em>-- BYTE, 1983-02</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the praise, the series was a commercial failure, likely due to its high cost.</p>

<h2>1983-02 PC Magazine declares 1983 the year of mouse</h2>
<p><img src="history/16_pcmag83.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you skim over PC Magazine from 1982, you are more likely to find a mention of Mickey Mouse than a &quot;mouse&quot; as a pointer device. The next year, though, they proclaim &quot;The Year of Mouse on PC&quot;. The actual year of mouse in the Lunar calendar was actually 1984, what a shame. A big feature of the February issue is not-yet released VisiOn which is going to be all about the mouse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue marks the unofficial IBM debut of California’s second-most famous rodent: the computer mouse. (Mickey and Minnie’s first-born, &quot;Micro”?)
<em>-- PC Mag, February 1983</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...menu-driven systems as Apple’s new Lisa or the Xerox 8010 (better known as the “Star”) have, in fact, elevated the mouse's status from a laboratory curiosity to rodent stardom.
<em>-- &quot;The Tale Of The Mouse&quot;, PC Mag, 02/83</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You simply point to what you want to do by using a mouse... VisiOn handles windows on the screen in a way that makes it look as if one piece of paper is on top of another...</p>
</blockquote>
