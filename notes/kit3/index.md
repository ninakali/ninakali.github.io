# Emergency kit Mk3 - survival medkit

Disclaimer: this is an unsponsored article. I am building my kit as I see fit for myself.

## Overview
This kit is an upgraded version of my [previous kit](../kit2/), after trying out some of its components in different situations.

It was mainly extended thanks to knowledge I received in a first aid course, and can help in more situations than my previous kit. It is noticeably heavier (955g/2.1lb vs 588g/1.3lb), but it's roughly the same volume. It still isn't too heavy to carry around at most times - it's roughly the size and weight of a hardcover book. 

Please note that this emergency kit is highly personal and is meant as a measure against threats that I either faced in the past or consider a possibility in the nearest future. If you think I am missing something important, please let me know.

## Reasons for upgrading
I went to first-aid courses, learned lots of new skills, and realised that my kit is missing some important stuff. I bought a slightly bigger first-aid kit as a new vessel for the kit.

The original kit is neat and lightweight; it can be a good starting point for your kit. Fun note: it didn't have scissors in the scissors compartment.

This is most of the kit's contents. Dressings, gloves, tapes, thermometers, anti-diarrhoea and painkillers. Pretty decent. I wonder if the scissors are missing by mistake?

## Repack
I merged my old kit with this new kit, and added some extra nice things. After repacking, the kit is 955g.

It can be opened on a horizontal plane neatly, without things falling out. It has a few "extras" that could fall out in emergency, but it wouldn't be too much of a problem.

## Main compartment and extras
A food bar, a tea candle and a flint striker, a space blanket, an extra dressing and an insect repellent are all "extras". I have other dressings, other light and fire sources, and another emergency blanket in the kit, so those are doubles. Insect repellent is a bonus againt ticks, and a single food bar isn't going to make a lot of difference. I am still considering replacing some of those with other useful bits.

The kit comes with some sticky tape; I put my pocket flashlight inside, and fixed it with a pocket toothbrush. The flashlight is better than I could hope for, I tried and tested it multiple times, it's pretty decent. The toothbrush can double down as a tool for abrasive wound cleaning.

## Info & gloves
I kept the vinyl gloves from the kit, and added an extra pair. Somehow I use the gloves fairly often, so I want to have extras. There's also some waterproof paper for notes, a pencil, and magnifying glass. I keep the personal info and a bit of cash there, too. Basic first aid manual is the one provided by Riot Medicine; I didn't quite like the manual that comes with the first aid kit, it's too basic. Finally, there's a tiny clip-on compass.

## Non-waterproof compartment
"Dressings"? I guess I need to replace the stickers showing the names of the compartments. This compartment isn't water-tight, so the pieces of kit there either aren't too afraid of humidity, or pre-packed.

Swiss knife rules. I've used it plenty of times by now, and it's been indispensable little helper. Then there's blades and paperclips - both are multifunctional and quite convenient to have. The biggest piece in this compartment is survival blanket; much bigger and more durable than a regular space blanket, and, most importantly, reuseable. There's also matches, blister plasters, towerls, sterile saline, tapes, tweezers, and a spare water filter.

That's not all! The pocket in this compartment also has dressings. Unlike the previous kit, they're sterile, some of them are low-adherent (to reduce trauma when removed). There's also a burn gel on a pad. This compartment also holds a few ziplocks, and a collapsible "cup".

## Medication/accessories compartment
Again, it's more than just the label says. I had to rearrange items so they'd fit, not by their function.

The first part of this compartment has lots of medications, plus AM/FM radio, plasters and thermometers. Some of the meds are specific for me, but most aren't: painkillers, anti-diarrhoea, antacids, steroids, antiseptic cream, water purification tablets. The radio can be opened to extract two extra batteries for the flashlight.

The second part of this compartment is alcoholic and non-alcoholic wipes (can be used as fire starters), steristrips, and a bunch of paraffin gauze. Paraffin gauze is non-adhesive, can be used as a fire starter (it burns well, but I couldn't light it up with a flint), or as a source of petroleum jelly (to treat dry skin or lips). Finally, there's a face mask.

## Outside of the kit
I keep a loud whistle and a CPR mask strapped to the kit.
