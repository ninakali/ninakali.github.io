<p>If you didn't know, magnetic-core memory used to be the most commonly
 used previous generation of memory before SRAM and DRAM integrated 
circuits stole its market share, with a promise of cheap and dense 
memory.</p>
<p>The foundation of the core memory is a core. Simply put, it is a tiny
 ring of a ferromagnetic material, a mixture of iron oxide with other 
metal oxides, that can be magnetized and de-magnetized.</p>
<p>As you might remember from a physics textbook, an electric current generates a magnetic field, and the
direction of the current changes the orientation of the magnetic field. If we let current through the
core in one direction, it will magnetize the core one way; if we let the current in the opposite
direction, it will magnetize the core in a different way.</p>
<p>Find a way to magnetize, read the magnetization of the core, and address thousands of the cores - and
you get yourself RAM, or computer memory.</p>
<p>The most advanced ferrite core memory had millions of cores!</p>
<p><img src="index_files/b5fa69e850ca9fe1.jpg" alt="A bag of tiny ferrite cores (about 32 thousand cores in the bag, if I am to believe the labeling)  in a zip lock on top of a bread board"></p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p>This specific type of core can be magnetized when a current of 0.3-0.5A passes through it. Ohm's
law says that if the voltage we supply is 5V, we need our circuit to have the resistance of 10 Ohms to
reach this current.</p>
<p>But we don't really need to supply this current all the time! The core changes magnetization really
quick, so we need something that would generate a short pulse. Things that generate short pulses aren't
great at dealing with high currents (0.5A is 20 times higher than what Arduino can handle), so we need a
simple switch to control the current.</p>
<p>I am basically using a textbook circuit with a popular transistor 2N2222 that can handle currents up to
0.8A. It doesn't look super pretty on the bread board, and the reality is different from the model, so
the current I see from the 5V supply is only 0.250A.</p>
<p>I pump the voltage up to 12V and smell the magic smoke coming out of the transistor. Of course it cannot
handle this much emitter-base voltage, and dies.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/5b8b66cf534e903f.png" alt="An electronic circuit: the switch on the left is opening the transistor  through a 1K resistor (in the center), so the current is going through the 10 Ohm load (upper right corner) is 421.1 mA.">
<img src="index_files/a4c85b4990a83795.png" alt="The same circuit. The switch is off, the transistor's base is connected to the ground through a 20K resistor and therefore is 0V. Transistor is locked, so there is virtually no current flowing through the load (10.2 pA, which is basically nothing in this case)">

</div>
<div class="post">
<p>I bring out Arduino as the easiest thing I can use to supply 5V (and send short impulses). Now the
circuit has two power sources: 5V for the transistor switching, and 12V for the core operations.</p>
<p>Now I can send the current through the core and magnetize/demagnetize it. Recording bits into memory has
never been easier.</p>
<p>How do I read it back, though?</p>
<p>I have an oscilloscope connected to the second wire going through the core. The oscilloscope is
basically a very precise voltmeter that can chart the voltage over time.</p>
<p>When we send the pulse through the core, and the core was magnetized in the same direction as it would
be now, we will see a 500ns voltage spike followed by constant 40mV - our core becomes a poor tiny
transformer.</p>
<p>If the core was magnetized in the opposite direction to our current, it'll require extra energy to reach
the same state, which will cause changes in the voltage pattern. In fact, there are two voltage
patterns, depending on how the core was magnetized!</p>

<img src="index_files/b0445757585deb77.jpg" alt="The oscilloscope chart of the pulse - there's a 500ns spike of 80 milli-volts of voltage, followed by slow decay at around 40mV">
<img src="index_files/96b6426173952b58.jpg" alt="The oscilloscope chart of a bit transition. After a voltage spike, there is a 20mV dip lasting for 1000 nanoseconds or so, indicating that the core was magnetized in the opposite direction.">

</div>
<div class="post">
<p>And so we have it. A tiny bit of magnetic material storing a single bit of data, we can record the
data by passing the current in different directions, and we can read the data back by passing the known
current through the core and seeing if there are any dips/hills in the voltage indicating that the core
was pre-magnetized differently.</p>
<p>There are clever tricks about arranging the bits into grid and adding an extra wire to simplify
"refresh" cycle of the memory after reading the bit out of it. I recommend videos by CuriousMarc if you
want a great demonstration of the core RAM, but today I want to talk about other aspect of the core RAM
making at home, which is a more interesting aspect to me:</p>
<p>Can we make the cores at home?</p>
<p>Those "Ferrites" I keep talking about are just a special type of ceramics. Iron oxide, zinc oxide
and manganese oxide are mixed and baked at really high temperatures until the ferrite ceramics is
formed. Its magnetic properties are all weird, so its usually ground into powder and pressed into
desired shape.</p>
<p>Obviously, we cannot replicate this at home. But we could mix iron oxide with clay and bake it, getting
a material with SOME magnetic properties. The best I could manage was 1:1 mixture of Fe3O4 and clay -
and even so, it is hard to work with (aka shape). It has strong magnetic properties, but there was no
way I could magnetize/demagnetize such a large chunk of magnetic material with measly 0.5A applied for a
microsecond.</p>
<p>I was about to give up on the idea, when I heard about "twistor memory". Twistor and plated-wire memory
are a bit irrelevant here, but the patents for these say something awesome:</p>
<p>"Wrap a magnetic tape around a wire, and you'll get yourself a ferrite core."</p>
<p><img src="index_files/2b0dbc60abcdd804.jpg" alt="A hand made clay-iron oxide ring that has some magnetic properties - it is surrounded by wires and plugged into the circuit"></p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p>Before you get your hopes high, I will tell you: it didn't work as a drop-in replacement for the
cores I have. It has SOME ferromagnetic properties, but it requires further experiments with figuring
out the magnetic properties of the "cores", and I need a completely different experiment rig for that.</p>
<p>The first thing I have tried was a steel wire with magnetic tape wound around it (check out links in my
profile if you haven't seen the DIY tape experiment). It didn't work, maybe because steel is ~bad as a
magnetic material. Maybe the ring was too large and I need more current.</p>
<p>One of the twistor patents mentioned using nickel, it has better magnetic properties. I repeated the
experiment with "nickel wire", but I did not see any difference. My "nickel" might be not nickel at all,
as it shows zero magnetic properties.</p>
<p>The last thing I've tried was avoiding any "core" of the core, and just wrapping the magnetic tape
around the write and sense wires directly. No dice.</p>
<p>I'll research more.</p>
<p>&lt;/thread&gt;</p>
