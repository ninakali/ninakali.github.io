<p>There is a famous ancient saying: &quot;If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go
together.&quot; As it happens, it is probably made up. Even if it was real, I don't think it is
necessarily true, especially in the context of game development.</p>
<p>I have been making games since my teenage years. Most of those projects were solitary efforts, and
they ended nowhere. Some of them were a team effort, and, you guessed it, they ended nowhere, too.
Perhaps it is my luck, or maybe it is a trait of my character. It seems that any team that I
assemble for any project longer than a couple of weeks ends up falling apart. And this includes
projects where I'd hire professionals, too, so maybe I am a bad boss, after all. Still, there's
nothing that screams &quot;the project is over&quot; as much as your lead artist starting to avoid you. :D</p>
<p>To avoid such situations, I decided to tackle a whole (small-ish) project on my own. A month ago, I
started to think I was ready to start a new game project. Originally, I wanted to make a full version
of &quot;Tech&amp;Blood&quot;, but that would take years of work. I need to be realistic about my abilities.</p>
<p>I've been handling writing, coding and music for my previous games, and I have some expertise in
these areas. But I want to make a game I can be proud of, all by myself, so I am trying to improve
my art skills in parallel with the development. This means the project scope must be small.</p>
<p>What kind of project will it be?</p>
<p>With all the meat in &quot;YuruCamp&quot;, &quot;Mono&quot;, and &quot;ZatsuTabi&quot;, I've been yearning for a vegan cooking
story. But a vegan cooking story in a &quot;cute girls doing cute stuff&quot; style would be disingenuous.
You can't just ignore all the ethical stuff and pretend it's not there, right? So I thought, and
thought, and realised: how about a show where you cook vegan food to heal your soul in a world as
broken as ours?</p>
<p>And so, I'm writing a script for &quot;Cooking For My Revolutionary Friend&quot;, typing so fast the keys of
my typewriter get stuck.</p>
