<p>It slowly dawns on me: a cooking game about oppression is going to be very bittersweet. I feel like I should compose more upbeat music for it, but I end up jotting down ideas for sad music one after the other.</p>
<p>However, when I get ideas for upbeat songs, I end up vibing to them a lot. Like this hook!</p>
<p>It is all MIDI for now, I'll need to arrange it for MilkyTracker so it'd sound good on Gameboy Advance (yep, it's going to be a Gameboy Advance game!)</p>
<p>It's been about a month since I decided I'm going to work on a small-ish game project. A month in absolute time sounds like a lot, but I probably only spent ten hours on it so far. There is not as much free time in my life as I want.</p>

<p>When you are &quot;Cooking For Your Revolutionary Friends&quot;, you are likely to encounter some danger. I think this track (again, still MIDI and work in progress) is going to work really well to depict danger.</p>
<p>I shamelessly stole the idea of having alternating crescendo and decrescendo from bar to bar from a very famous video game.</p>

<p>Finally, I am really thankful to my past self for creating so many little melodies. I find unfinished MIDI files all around, and sometimes I feel like they sound almost okay and can be used in the game after a bit of tweaking. For example, this track is full of anxious DETERMINATION, but like, what is happening with the &quot;piano's right hand&quot; part of the melody here?</p>
