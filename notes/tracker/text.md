# Let's chip these tunes: an interactive introduction to tracker music

Do you like the sound of NES, Sega, GameBoy, Commodore, ZX Spectrum and so on? Do you want to make music in the style and spirit of vintage video games? This guide will teach you the basics of music making, sound synthesis, beatmaking, and song composition. 

We will start from zero, and in the next three hours or so, you will create a cover of a pop song and even compose a simple song. The guide is software-agnostic; you can transfer things you learn to any platform or tracker software.

If you have questions or problems, or want to share your little creations, please leave a comment. 

## Rock Bottom
The true story of a failed tracker musician.

She was on the brink of discovering something truly special. It turns out that the Music Editor used for many famous video games was actually free! Moreover, it was not something tailored for professional musicians; most people making music with it probably had never gone to a music school.

The download took only a few long moments. Soon, she discovered that this Awesome Music-Making Program comes with lots of examples and a hefty 368-page manual. The interface looked overwhelming, sure, but she managed to play a demo song with it, and it blew her mind. 

(insert example)

The song was made by a regular person, just like her, using a regular PC and this very program. The advertisement did not lie. It was not a program for musicians but for regular computer people. She, too, could make a song. She was eager to make one and immediately created a new file. A couple of hours later, her first "masterpiece" was complete.

(insert example)

She listened to the track she made one more time. The thrill was gone, and all she felt was a shame. She even flipped through the manual's pages only to find words she didn't know. "Portamento"? "Grooves"? "ADPCM"? There was no chapter explaining any of it. There was no chapter on how to make it sound good, either. Resignedly, she decided to exit the program. The computer asked her if she wanted to save the changes before exiting the program. "No, I don't have the talent", she chose.

But it wasn't the talent that she missed. It was the fundamental knowledge.

Don't get me wrong. It is possible to make incredible tracker compositions without learning about the basics of the music, just like it is possible to paint a masterpiece without any formal art education. It is even possible that by avoiding formal learning, you could break free from the existing limitations and create music that would sound like nothing before it. But a much more likely outcome is that you will quit music.

The alternative is to try and learn just enough to make a simple but satisfying song and only *then* decide whether you want to discover new sounds by yourself, as a "musical hermit", or to learn more about the world of sound. And it is only one click away.
