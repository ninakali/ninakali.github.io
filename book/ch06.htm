<h1>06. Linguistic challenges</h1>
<p>One of the things that I would like to attempt in this project is to bootstrap a
human language. Linguists were able to figure out ancient human languages
in cases when enough texts in the language had been preserved. I want to make
such a book where a process of &quot;deciphering&quot; the language the book is written in
will be if not trivial, then at least accessible to most people capable of seeing
and thinking.</p>
<p>Naturally, it calls for a parallel with language learning methods that don't use
any language but the target language. These methods can be fun and also are quite
successful in teaching the languages, which is awesome. But those methods heavily rely
on shared cultural context. If you know what a table fork is, being shown multiple chairs
and hearing &quot;vydelka!&quot; every time can help to make a connection between the object and the
word used for it. If you don't know what &quot;a fork&quot; is, you might be able to learn the word
for the object, but it won't help you in any way. Is it a weapon? Is it a gardening tool?
Why people are putting it in their mouths? Who knows!</p>
<p>We cannot assume the person reading the book will know about everyday objects
of the modern Western world. It is mandatory to find out what concepts, tools
and objects are known by literally everyone. Thankfully, there are many!</p>
<p>First, some concepts can be understood even by chordates, or at least mammals:
hunger, food, thirst, drink, body parts, and even emotions and feelings associated with
those. Then, there are concepts common for social animals: in-group, out-group, children,
and parents. There are also objects of the natural world, which of course need to be identified
correctly first.</p>
<p>Another approach could be finding similarities and the smallest common denominator across cultures and
languages. Apparently, there are multiple lists of words that can be used to bootstrap a language.
There's Toki Pona, a minimalist constructed language, that only needs a few dozen of words. Perhaphs,
comparing the vocabulary of ancient languages to the vocabulary of modern languages can unveil what
concepts have survived millennia, and are likely to survive for as long.</p>
