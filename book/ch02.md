# 02. A brief overview of similar works

As already mentioned, there are multiple books and resources that have similar or
overlapping topics. It is worth going over what they have to offer, as well as recount
their specific weaknesses. You probably will notice that many share common traits.

## Encyclop√¶dia Britannica
THE printed encyclopedia on general knowledge in the English-speaking world.
Too thick and complex to be used as a textbook.

**Pros:** 
* Covers a very wide range of topics, many of those are covered with
significant attention to the details.

**Cons:** 
* Massive: over 32 thousand pages long.
* Complicated: when an article is detailed enough, it requires reading multiple 
related articles to understand what it talks about.
* Conceptual: rarely goes into specifics of practical applications.
* Convoluted: there is no progression from simple to complex. The articles are
expected to be consumed out of order anyways.
* Full of trivia: a large chunk of the Britannica is information about people or locations. 


## The Knowledge: How To Rebuild Our World After An Apocalypse
This book focuses on a scenario where, for some reason, the civilisation is dead
and needs to be rebuilt. Interestingly, the author explores the history of many 
human attempts at building "the total book". 

**Pros:**
* Practical: The author clearly understands that the ability to apply the knowledge 
is very important.
* Well-structured: The book starts with covering the basic necessities, and expands
to very advanced technologies.

**Cons:**
* Superficial: The book doesn't deliver on its promises of being practical by not
providing specific enough details.
* West-focused (perhaps, even US-focused): The book makes many assumptions about
what kind of technology level and knowledge is readily available and easily
obtainable.
* Too advanced: The book would be very hard to understand for the reader without a
general education (high-school level or so).
